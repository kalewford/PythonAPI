Analysis
On the first graph (City Latitude vs Max Temperature), the latitude at 0 is equivalent to the equator. We can see that at 0, the max temperatures are at the highest. Anything going further from 0, the temperatures begin decreasing.
On the other graphs, it doesn't seem like there is any correlation between latitude and the other chosen variables. Cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed varies across all latitudes.
The only variable that is dependent on latitude is temperature.
